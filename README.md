# jsdbg

A JavaScript debugger with the intent to make people who use a lot of GDB at home with debugging node.js
programs from the terminal. Kind of like the `node inspect` utility.

## Goals

- follow gdb where applicable
- scriptable debugger
- reasonably old node.js support
- source map support

## see if node's `module` module makes it easier to resolve sourcemaps
